# Python-Resources
Hi! Jacob Here.

Below I have listed some useful resources for those who are learning python for the first time.

This list is a work in progress, I will be updating it regularly :)

## TechWithTim
You cannot go wrong with TechWithTim, all of his tutorials are concise, accurate and jargon-free (at a beginners level at least).

For a decent understanding of python, you only really need the beginner tutorials.
Advanced/Intermediate really isn't needed at all, but it is where the most interesting aspects of python lie in my opinion.

## CodeWars
This website contains a plethora of interesting, quick-to-complete challenges in a whole range of languages (Including Python).
This is quite good for general practice after getting the basics down.

## Python References

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) 

*Really friendly references to most of pythons core functionality*

[Python3 Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) 

*A bit heavy on the technical jargon, but highly valuable to more intermediate programmers*

## General References

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

*Good for asking questions, and finding solutions from people who have had the exact same problems*

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

*Use as a last resort. Occasionally it can come in use, but you really don't want to stay around the reddit userbase for too long*
