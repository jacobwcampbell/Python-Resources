# Python-Resources
Hi! Jacob Here.

Below I have listed some useful resources for those who are learning python for the first time.

## TechWithTim
You cannot go wrong with TechWithTim, all of his tutorials are concise, accurate and jargon-free (at a beginners level at least).

For a decent understanding of python, you only really need the beginner tutorials.
Advanced/Intermediate really isn't needed at all, but it is where the most interesting aspects of python lie in my opinion.
